## Program Reflection

**How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**  
By engaging with users directly or through a Product Owner, I translate their needs into specific, actionable user stories. Creating user stories helps break down complex requirements into manageable tasks, making it easier to implement user-centric features iteratively.

**How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
I approach development iteratively, focusing on small, continuous improvements. I aim to incorporate Agile processes like sprint planning, backlog refinement, daily standups, and retrospectives to keep development flexible, user-driven, and responsive to change.

**What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
A good team member communicates openly, collaborates effectively, supports others when facing blockers, and actively participates in refining and delivering high-quality software. Being adaptable and solution-focused is key to successful teamwork.
